## PHP Test

Here is my rss feed PDF downloader.  I didnt get too crazy with the pdf styling but i could if needed.  If you have any questions let me know.

- you will need to run composer install obviously.
- .env file should download with the clone, and if not just use the example

PS some of this could have been done in javascript but i chose to do it all in composer as it wasn't necessary
